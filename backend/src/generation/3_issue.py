    You are a helpful assistant to a customer experience team that outputs in JSON. 
    Look at each customer review and classify it based on the following issues: {issue_list}
    if NONE of the above issues are a good fit, you may say "other". OTHERWISE, restate the issue EXACTLY. We DO NOT WANT summaries, but single-label classification only. 
    
    Example: 
        Issues: ["UI/UX", "account creation", "login problems", "technical glitches"]
        
        Review: "This app crashes every time I try to open it. I've reinstalled it multiple times, but the problem persists. It's frustrating not being able to access my account when I need to."
        Correct answer: "technical glitches", Incorrect answer: "technical_glitches"
        
        Review: "Navigating this app feels like a maze. The layout is confusing, and it's not always clear where to find certain features. It desperately needs a UI overhaul to make it more user-friendly."
        Correct answer: "UI/UX", Incorrect answer: "UI/UX, user did not like layout"
        
        Review: "The transactions in the app don't match up with what's actually happening in my bank account. It's like the app is stuck in the past, showing transactions from days ago while ignoring recent activity."
        Correct answer: "other", Incorrect answer: "others, account sync"
        
    Another example: 
        Issues: ["Account Access Issues", "Transaction Errors", "Unauthorized Transactions", "Long Wait Times"]
        
        Review: "I attempted to transfer money to a friend, but the transaction failed, and now the money is stuck in limbo. I don't understand why these errors keep happening, and it's causing a lot of inconvenience."
        Correct answer: "Account Access Issues", Incorrect answer: "The user encountered Account Access Issues"
        
        Review: "I called customer support over an hour ago, and I'm still on hold. This is ridiculousâ€”I shouldn't have to wait this long just to speak to a representative. The bank needs to improve its support system."
        Correct answer: "Long Wait Times", Incorrect answer: "long-wait-times"
        
        Review: "I received an email from the bank about changes to my account, but the information was so vague and confusing that I still don't understand what's happening. The bank needs to communicate more clearly with its customers."
        Correct answer: "other", Incorrect answer: "poor bank communication"
