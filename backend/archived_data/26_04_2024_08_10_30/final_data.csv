Since I usually only carry my phone, Apple Pay makes my life more convenient. However GXS doesn’t support it, and I am forced to use a traditional bank debit card to pay instead. Please please implement Apple Pay for your customers, even Trust Bank has already implemented it long ago. I know you listen to customers feedback because you added payees finally.

Also, please also try to get NETS on your debit card and your app for NETS QR. Paynow isn’t readily accepted by all SGQR payments. If you want a customer base for the underbanked, you need the basics of what is nearly every retail banking has.","{'id': 43309978, 'body': 'Hi Aloyies!

The user interfaces is so intuitive that every button can be found with your eyes close, that makes money transfer so much smoother. Also the colours is so slick that I want to turn the app on everyday just to look at it and see the daily interest

3,2023-09-09 08:33:43,Apple,GXS,1.0,"Notice that the drop in interest rate of 0.8% in saving accounts. GXS just come out with a reason to say many consumers want a increase in interest rate in main accounts as most of their funds are there to get the 1.2x points for dash and grab spending. Hence they decrease the interest rate to 2.68% in saving account and increase to 2.38% in main account .

The thing is GXS can increase the main account interest and maintain the interest rate in saving account. They will attract more consumer in this case. However, they use this opportunity to decease the interest rate in saving account instead and use the consumer as an excuse for the decrease.

I am very disappointed in GXS and have close my account in GXS. There are other banks offering a higher interest rate such as OCBC and UOB for saving accounts. No point sticking to GXS.","{'id': 38832230, 'body': 'Hi there! We’re sorry to make you feel that way, and we’ll definitely take this in as a feedback.

When i asked if theres a Website to access the notifications, or if the bank can unlock the card from their side, the customer service officer just said “they’ll refer my case and unlock my card in 3 working days”, and asked if I have any other issues.

There’s no case-by-case assessment available. This is quite a departure from a friendly and smart digital bank image that Trust is trying to portray, and this is ironically, particularly unfriendly to their target audience, young population who are more well-versed in and receptive of technology.

It is a total disappointment to be given such a reply that it is not possible.

However I really wish that my monthly salary can be transferred or credited to my Trust Bank account just like other banks did. I was disappointed to learn from your customer service department that your bank don’t provide such services as I mentioned earlier.

I truly hope that your bank could implement the monthly salary or even the yearly government GSTV payout to be credited via fast or whatsoever credit transfer system that your bank could implement.

521,2023-01-31 00:09:57,Apple,Trust,1.0,I didn’t know each customer only had 1 chance to waive of late charge. I made my payment for $13.90 on Fri and I didn’t know the interbank takes 3 days so I was slapped with $100 fee again. Since I used up my chance the customer service officer will submit for approval. I already made late payments before when I was truly late. Trust has earned more late fee from me since my payments were very little and once I was charged for late fee as I left out $1 when I made my payment. Definitely not a bank for more complex transactions as the customer service is terrible and they go by the book instead of listening to the customer. The fella seems happy that I want to close my card too. A bank needs to listen to customer needs and not just give rewards.,
