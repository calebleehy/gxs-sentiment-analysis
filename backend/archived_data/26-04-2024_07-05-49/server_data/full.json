        "review": "Notice that the drop in interest rate of 0.8% in saving accounts. GXS just come out with a reason to say many consumers want a increase in interest rate in main accounts as most of their funds are there to get the 1.2x points for dash and grab spending. Hence they decrease the interest rate to 2.68% in saving account and increase to 2.38% in main account .\n\nThe thing is GXS can increase the main account interest and maintain the interest rate in saving account. They will attract more consumer in this case. However, they use this opportunity to decease the interest rate in saving account instead and use the consumer as an excuse for the decrease.\n\nI am very disappointed in GXS and have close my account in GXS. There are other banks offering a higher interest rate such as OCBC and UOB for saving accounts. No point sticking to GXS."

Getting bonuses just by spending $200 outside of NTUC is so much less stressful and much more achievable than some other banks which require spending $500 monthly. Love the coupons and vouchers, first time having an app where the coupons/vouchers are much more relatable and useful, just my personal opinion. Notifications will be there whenever there\u2019s a new transaction or the transaction has been processed. Using it for transactions overseas was also really convenient. Customer service was good too, not sure why there are so many people complaining about it. App is smooth overall, just some hiccups when Face ID was suddenly not available (deleting and re-download the app helps). But knowing that it\u2019s still a very new digital bank, these kinds of errors may be unavoidable at the start. Great job overall, keep it up!"

I wrote an email and followed up twice in the last two days, but again, no one reply.

Not to mention, whoever is running this credit card is probably the most apathetic person on Earth. Literally makes you feel like you owe them. Late payment? Good luck. You got to plead your case. Asked for a waiver but you need to provide reason. Are we in school? The cs makes you feel like they are doing you a service and you should be grateful. \"On a one-time goodwill\" I quote them. There's nothing good about this card other than the zero foreign transaction fees. Be careful not to miss your repayment date and think before you set it cause you cannot change it. Very incredibly inflexible to say the least. The cs increases your blood pressure. Even telcos have better cs. Sign for the freebies, redeem those and run. Please get this right, customers do not owe you our business. Stop giving us your elitist attitude. It really feels like I have to praise the gods and kiss the feet of your cs cause they waived a fee. \ud83e\udd2e\n\nAnd the developer's replies is even more infuriating. It's like rubbing it in your face. Not replying is even better than replying some sarcastic template reply."

It is a total disappointment to be given such a reply that it is not possible.

What\u2019s more they only waive the penalty for one time..2nd time and there\u2019s no more waiver. A $100 slapped for a $14 spend on the card. Ridiculous. Effinn ridiculous. That\u2019s how this \u2018bank\u2019 makes money by low infrastructure cost and inflexible policies"

I was disappointed to learn from your customer service department that your bank don\u2019t provide such services as I mentioned earlier.\n\nI truly hope that your bank could implement the monthly salary or even the yearly government GSTV payout to be credited via fast or whatsoever credit transfer system that your bank could implement.\n\nI look forward to your Bank representative reply pertaining to the suggestion that I mentioned above. Please look into this matter considerably and with a positive outcome.Thank you."

Since I used up my chance the customer service officer will submit for approval. I already made late payments before when I was truly late. Trust has earned more late fee from me since my payments were very little and once I was charged for late fee as I left out $1 when I made my payment. Definitely not a bank for more complex transactions as the customer service is terrible and they go by the book instead of listening to the customer. The fella seems happy that I want to close my card too. A bank needs to listen to customer needs and not just give rewards."

Love the dark theme too, just got to fix some of those issues so i never have to use other banks again. Its just mostly app design/ features issues which I doubt will be difficult toimplement in the near future. some advice - offer the features other banking apps offer and many people will make the switch. simply a better app!"

Told them I need the funds before the Uob bank close. Definitely going to close the Savings account. Easy to transfer $ in, so difficult to transfer $ out."
