1,2022-11-09 03:13:16,Apple,GXS,5.0,"A bank like no other, no bank have such amazing feature to separate your money into different ‚Äúpockets‚Äù to keep track of your goals. Moreover the interest rate they give is the highest for the no effort! Interest are being deposit daily and it‚Äôs amazing to see üíµ coming in to the bank daily! 

The user interfaces is so intuitive that every button can be found with your eyes close, that makes money transfer so much smoother. Also the colours is so slick that I want to turn the app on everyday just to look at it and see the daily interest

Lots of potential for the product and I can‚Äôt wait to see more of it.",Positive,Banking,-
2,2023-09-09 08:33:43,Apple,GXS,1.0,"Notice that the drop in interest rate of 0.8% in saving accounts. GXS just come out with a reason to say many consumers want a increase in interest rate in main accounts as most of their funds are there to get the 1.2x points for dash and grab spending. Hence they decrease the interest rate to 2.68% in saving account and increase to 2.38% in main account .

The thing is GXS can increase the main account interest and maintain the interest rate in saving account. They will attract more consumer in this case. However, they use this opportunity to decease the interest rate in saving account instead and use the consumer as an excuse for the decrease.

I am very disappointed in GXS and have close my account in GXS. There are other banks offering a higher interest rate such as OCBC and UOB for saving accounts. No point sticking to GXS.",Neutral,Banking,Interest rate concerns

Transferring money OUT is a huge issue. Since June I‚Äôve had problems transferring amounts higher than $500 back to my other banking accounts, each time a red banner will pop up and said something went wrong please try again later. TODAY I can‚Äôt transfer more than $1000 back to myself - even the $1000 had to be transferred in TWO transactions of $500 each.

I truly hope that your bank could implement the monthly salary or even the yearly government GSTV payout to be credited via fast or whatsoever credit transfer system that your bank could implement.

Since I used up my chance the customer service officer will submit for approval. I already made late payments before when I was truly late. Trust has earned more late fee from me since my payments were very little and once I was charged for late fee as I left out $1 when I made my payment. Definitely not a bank for more complex transactions as the customer service is terrible and they go by the book instead of listening to the customer.
