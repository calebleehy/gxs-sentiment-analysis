Not to mention, whoever is running this credit card is probably the most apathetic person on Earth. Literally makes you feel like you owe them. Late payment? Good luck. You got to plead your case. Asked for a waiver but you need to provide reason. Are we in school? The cs makes you feel like they are doing you a service and you should be grateful. \"On a one-time goodwill\" I quote them. There's nothing good about this card other than the zero foreign transaction fees. Be careful not to miss your repayment date and think before you set it cause you cannot change it. Very incredibly inflexible to say the least. The cs increases your blood pressure. Even telcos have better cs. Sign for the freebies, redeem those and run. Please get this right, customers do not owe you our business. Stop giving us your elitist attitude. It really feels like I have to praise the gods and kiss the feet of your cs cause they waived a fee. 🤮\n",
