Please allow us to add and/or save payees so we don‚Äôt have to keep typing out UEN numbers or account numbers. Would be nice to be able to add the debit card to Apple Pay too!!"
3,"Positive","Savings Features","Acknowledge and thank for positive feedback on savings features","Opinion","A bank like no other, no bank have such amazing feature to separate your money into different ‚Äúpockets‚Äù to keep track of your goals. Moreover the interest rate they give is the highest for the no effort! Interest are being deposit daily and it‚Äôs amazing to see üíµ coming in to the bank daily! 

The user interfaces is so intuitive that every button can be found with your eyes close, that makes money transfer so much smoother. Also the colours is so slick that I want to turn the app on everyday just to look at it and see the daily interest

Lots of potential for the product and I can‚Äôt wait to see more of it."
4,"Negative","Interest Rates and Account Management","Investigate account issue with interest rates","Issue","Notice that the drop in interest rate of 0.8% in saving accounts. GXS just come out with a reason to say many consumers want a increase in interest rate in main accounts as most of their funds are there to get the 1.2x points for dash and grab spending. Hence they decrease the interest rate to 2.68% in saving account and increase to 2.38% in main account .

The thing is GXS can increase the main account interest and maintain the interest rate in saving account. They will attract more consumer in this case. However, they use this opportunity to decease the interest rate in saving account instead and use the consumer as an excuse for the decrease.

I am very disappointed in GXS and have close my account in GXS. There are other banks offering a higher interest rate such as OCBC and UOB for saving accounts. No point sticking to GXS."
5,"Negative","Account Transfer Experience","Investigate account transfer issues","Feedback","Sending money into my GXS account is a breeze and instantaneous - regardless of the amounts. I‚Äôm able to immediately see that my funds are in GXS. 

Transferring money OUT is a huge issue. Since June I‚Äôve had problems transferring amounts higher than $500 back to my other banking accounts, each time a red banner will pop up and said something went wrong please try again later. TODAY I can‚Äôt transfer more than $1000 back to myself - even the $1000 had to be transferred in TWO transactions of $500 each. Customer service officers did their best to help each time but it‚Äôs annoying that the advice provided (killing the app, re-logging in with SingPass) still don‚Äôt work."
6,"Positive","UI/UX Design","Investigate Improve UI/UX","Issue","I have to say that the UI/UX is one of the best one I‚Äôll have seen for any Digibank mobile app and finally a strong market player that focuses on customer experience and design, which is critical as most banking products doesn‚Äôt differ much for any banks out there. Please make it available asap can‚Äôt wait to see what you have to offer!"
7,"Negative","Account Opening Process","Revisit account opening process design","Opinion","Have been waiting for a slot for the account since GXS started and have been waiting until now (about 7 months) and still nothing, whenever anyone ask for why, the excuses given are still mostly the same with no actual changes or improvements (people can‚Äôt help but compare to the other bank ‚Äútrust bank Singapore‚Äù that also launched just 1 day before GXS‚Äôs launch and believe trust bank Singapore to be better since trust bank can allow people to register without waiting for this long)"
8,"Positive","Account Accessibility and Transfer Issues","Thank you for your feedback. We will improve account accessibility.","Feedback","Great app, with awesome design and theme unlike traditional banking institutions. Provide high interest rates and suitable for targeted group of audience. Ratings were probably dragged down by reviewers who rated 1/5 because they couldn‚Äôt sign up - as GXS bank is rolling out to users by batches.

Overall a good experience! :)"
9,"Negative","UI/UX Design","Design fixes for identified UI issues","Issue","Hit with fast reversal when transferring money to this gxs bank, first time in my life a fast transfer didn‚Äôt succeed. Googled for recent reviews and social media on this gxs bank. Mostly bad reviews and issues. I don‚Äôt need developer reply to my review here as I‚Äôm absolutely not going to touch this bank anymore. And biggest joke of all, you don‚Äôt even have the most basic banking feature to save payee details. What kind of app development staff and quality is that???"

11,"Negative","Payee Management","Improve payee management interface","Feedback","What a joke! Nothing happens after you input your phone number - nothing! 

It‚Äôll be so much, and I don‚Äôt exaggerate when I say this, so much faster for you to travel from one end of Singapore to the other, to open an account at a traditional bank branch. 

One piece of advice to the management of GXS Bank - do not launch if you are not ready! You are a joke. Please look at Trust Bank. Simple and easy to use. Account opened in like, 2 mins?"

13,"Negative","App Performance","Investigate app crashes improve performance","Issue","My biggest frustration is that I can‚Äôt save payees when sending money.  Everytime I need to transfer funds, I have to select a transfer type and fully type out the account number, payee‚Äôs name, and select the bank.

This is incredibly tedious esp for accounts I pay frequently. Without this ‚Äúfundamental‚Äù feature a payee list, it‚Äôs easy to make mistakes entering long account number, name and bank name each time."

I referred this to another customer service personnel and was told the same thing, and insisting there is a notification i can tap to unlock my card, when I tried tapping every single one of my notifications in app, with 0 of them giving me any instructions 

When i asked if theres a Website to access the notifications, or if the bank can unlock the card from their side, the customer service officer just said ‚Äúthey‚Äôll refer my case and unlock my card in 3 working days‚Äù, and asked if I have any other issues. Just as i was about to type, the person left the chatroom.

Extremely annoyed at this entire situation, and if this app can streamline the customer service process, I would have rated it higher."
135,"Neutral","Credit Card Services","Acknowledge feedback request clarification","Feedback","Been using it for 3 months, everything‚Äôs great! Getting bonuses just by spending $200 outside of NTUC is so much less stressful and much more achievable than some other banks which require spending $500 monthly. Love the coupons and vouchers, first time having an app where the coupons/vouchers are much more relatable and useful, just my personal opinion. Notifications will be there whenever there‚Äôs a new transaction or the transaction has been processed. Using it for transactions overseas was also really convenient. Customer service was good too, not sure why there are so many people complaining about it. App is smooth overall, just some hiccups when Face ID was suddenly not available (deleting and re-download the app helps). But knowing that it‚Äôs still a very new digital bank, these kinds of errors may be unavoidable at the start. Great job overall, keep it up!"

I have been keep calling in the last three days and no matter what time I cal and how long I wait, there is forever no one answers. I feel like calling to a ghost. Imagine the other your card was lost and need immediate attention but no one is there to help you, do you still want to bank with them?
On 05Sept, I left a message in the chat group for help. After waiting for hours, someone answered saying I can cancel either on the Insurance‚Äôs official website or via email. I wrote an email and followed up twice in the last two days, but again, no one reply. Then I asked in the chat group on 06Sept on how to cancel on website since no one replies my email, and again, after waiting for hours, they told they also not sure and need a specialist to advise‚Ä¶However, till now there is still no so called ‚ÄúSpecialist‚Äù to contact me‚Ä¶
Such digital bank like Trust might be good at beginning with promotions/coupons. But what can eventually make their customers stay is the ‚ÄúService‚Äù. Can your imagine their Customer Service is like such?"
137,"Negative","Credit Card Services","Investigate transaction dispute","Issue","The interface is not intuitive at all. You literally have to keep tap this and that to get between pages. It's infuriating to say the least. Not to mention, whoever is running this credit card is probably the most apathetic person on Earth. Literally makes you feel like you owe them. Late payment? Good luck. You got to plead your case. Asked for a waiver but you need to provide reason. Are we in school? The cs makes you feel like they are doing you a service and you should be grateful. ""On a one-time goodwill"" I quote them. There's nothing good about this card other than the zero foreign transaction fees. Be careful not to miss your repayment date and think before you set it cause you cannot change it. Very incredibly inflexible to say the least. The cs increases your blood pressure. Even telcos have better cs. Sign for the freebies, redeem those and run. Please get this right, customers do not owe you our business. Stop giving us your elitist attitude. It really feels like I have to praise the gods and kiss the feet of your cs cause they waived a fee. ü§Æ

And the developer's replies is even more infuriating. It's like rubbing it in your face. Not replying is even better than replying some sarcastic template reply."

App is also user friendly. I dont know if my recommendation will ever be implemented but i really hope it does because it will help trust bank stand out from other digibank apps even more. my recommendation is to add a section in the UI to include monthly spendings breakdown by categories. since trust bank already categorises our transactions (groceries, shopping, transport etc), the addition of a pie chart of our spending by category will really elevate the user experience to the next level."

There‚Äôs no case-by-case assessment available. This is quite a departure from a friendly and smart digital bank image that Trust is trying to portray, and this is ironically, particularly unfriendly to their target audience, young population who are more well-versed in and receptive of technology. Do something, perhaps?

Update: I‚Äôve enquired again through the in app chat as instructed by the reply, the correspondent threw me the same reason, telling me I didn‚Äôt meet the requirements.

It is a total disappointment to be given such a reply that it is not possible. I asked if their back office can‚Äôt process a simple credit limit increase request, then does this warrant a card cancellation and a re-application to get a higher credit limit; and the reply was that this is still subject to the bank‚Äôs review.

Very unreliable. Because the trust key is needed to send money, and every time it gets reset, i need to wait for the activation. Contacted your help. Customer sevrice is clueless and just tell me to reinstall. I'm super surprised and annoyed until i see comments from others having the same issues. I'm going to stop using this app and transfer all money out."
