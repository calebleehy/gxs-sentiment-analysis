1,45352,GXS,Apple,4,Negative,Praise,C,C1,Great banking app with attractive interest rates! Please allow us to add and/or save payees so we don‚Äôt have to keep typing out UEN numbers or account numbers. Would be nice to be able to add the debit card to Apple Pay too!!
2,44866,GXS,Apple,5,Negative,Feedback,D,D1,"A bank like no other, no bank have such amazing feature to separate your money into different ‚Äúpockets‚Äù to keep track of your goals. Moreover the interest rate they give is the highest for the no effort! Interest are being deposit daily and it‚Äôs amazing to see üíµ coming in to the bank daily! 

The user interfaces is so intuitive that every button can be found with your eyes close, that makes money transfer so much smoother. Also the colours is so slick that I want to turn the app on everyday just to look at it and see the daily interest

Lots of potential for the product and I can‚Äôt wait to see more of it."
3,45170,GXS,Apple,1,Negative,Complaint,D,D1,"Notice that the drop in interest rate of 0.8% in saving accounts. GXS just come out with a reason to say many consumers want a increase in interest rate in main accounts as most of their funds are there to get the 1.2x points for dash and grab spending. Hence they decrease the interest rate to 2.68% in saving account and increase to 2.38% in main account .

The thing is GXS can increase the main account interest and maintain the interest rate in saving account. They will attract more consumer in this case. However, they use this opportunity to decease the interest rate in saving account instead and use the consumer as an excuse for the decrease.

I am very disappointed in GXS and have close my account in GXS. There are other banks offering a higher interest rate such as OCBC and UOB for saving accounts. No point sticking to GXS."
4,45078,GXS,Apple,2,Neutral,Feedback,D,D1,"Sending money into my GXS account is a breeze and instantaneous - regardless of the amounts. I‚Äôm able to immediately see that my funds are in GXS. 

Transferring money OUT is a huge issue. Since June I‚Äôve had problems transferring amounts higher than $500 back to my other banking accounts, each time a red banner will pop up and said something went wrong please try again later. TODAY I can‚Äôt transfer more than $1000 back to myself - even the $1000 had to be transferred in TWO transactions of $500 each. Customer service officers did their best to help each time but it‚Äôs annoying that the advice provided (killing the app, re-logging in with SingPass) still don‚Äôt work."
5,44835,GXS,Apple,5,Neutral,Praise,C,C1,"I have to say that the UI/UX is one of the best one I‚Äôll have seen for any Digibank mobile app and finally a strong market player that focuses on customer experience and design, which is critical as most banking products doesn‚Äôt differ much for any banks out there. Please make it available asap can‚Äôt wait to see what you have to offer!"
6,45017,GXS,Apple,1,Positive,Feedback,A,A1,"Have been waiting for a slot for the account since GXS started and have been waiting until now (about 7 months) and still nothing, whenever anyone ask for why, the excuses given are still mostly the same with no actual changes or improvements (people can‚Äôt help but compare to the other bank ‚Äútrust bank Singapore‚Äù that also launched just 1 day before GXS‚Äôs launch and believe trust bank Singapore to be better since trust bank can allow people to register without waiting for this long)"
7,44927,GXS,Apple,5,Positive,Feedback,C,C1,"Great app, with awesome design and theme unlike traditional banking institutions. Provide high interest rates and suitable for targeted group of audience. Ratings were probably dragged down by reviewers who rated 1/5 because they couldn‚Äôt sign up - as GXS bank is rolling out to users by batches.

Overall a good experience! :)"
8,45170,GXS,Apple,1,Positive,Feedback,B,B1,"Hit with fast reversal when transferring money to this gxs bank, first time in my life a fast transfer didn‚Äôt succeed. Googled for recent reviews and social media on this gxs bank. Mostly bad reviews and issues. I don‚Äôt need developer reply to my review here as I‚Äôm absolutely not going to touch this bank anymore. And biggest joke of all, you don‚Äôt even have the most basic banking feature to save payee details. What kind of app development staff and quality is that???"
9,44896,GXS,Apple,5,Positive,Complaint,D,D1,"Very easy to use, user friendly and intuitive. Nice design of the app making it easier to navigate the app. Saving pocket is an interesting and useful feature. can‚Äôt wait to explore and use more of the app"
10,44805,GXS,Apple,1,Negative,Feedback,A,A1,"What a joke! Nothing happens after you input your phone number - nothing! 

It‚Äôll be so much, and I don‚Äôt exaggerate when I say this, so much faster for you to travel from one end of Singapore to the other, to open an account at a traditional bank branch. 

One piece of advice to the management of GXS Bank - do not launch if you are not ready! You are a joke. Please look at Trust Bank. Simple and easy to use. Account opened in like, 2 mins?"
11,45231,GXS,Apple,5,Negative,Feedback,D,D1,Honestly is my first time depositing digital banking A lot worry . But at the end is a great experience. I believe a lot of us wanted is the return . And they offer very high interest. Will continue to deposit Thank you
12,45139,GXS,Apple,1,Neutral,Praise,A,A1,"My biggest frustration is that I can‚Äôt save payees when sending money.  Everytime I need to transfer funds, I have to select a transfer type and fully type out the account number, payee‚Äôs name, and select the bank.

This is incredibly tedious esp for accounts I pay frequently. Without this ‚Äúfundamental‚Äù feature a payee list, it‚Äôs easy to make mistakes entering long account number, name and bank name each time."
13,45292,GXS,Apple,5,Negative,Complaint,B,B1,"Best bank to save up and best bank in receiving cash back! And also, so happy to be able to win a lucky draw from here! Hopefully things get much better in this year!"

15,44835,GXS,Apple,5,Negative,Praise,C,C1,Despite a lengthy onboarding but my account got approved promptly. I like that the app is snappy and easy to use. Waiting for credit card so that I can switch to GXS as my main account.

19,45170,GXS,Apple,1,Positive,Praise,A,A1,Already 1 year but basic functions like adding payee is not in the app. It‚Äôs so troublesome to transfer funds to different bank accounts! With your latest move to reduce interest to 2.68% has made me feels like maribank is better even with slightly lower interest rate because they knows what basic functions to include in the app
20,45323,GXS,Apple,1,Neutral,Feedback,C,C1,"Extremely disappointed with the GXS app. Despite consistent use on the same device for a long time, it suddenly stopped allowing money transfers with explanation device changed. This lack of clarity and abrupt disruption in service is unacceptable. Terrible user experience, deserves only 1 star."

3. No hassle with minimum sum"
49,45139,GXS,Apple,1,Neutral,Praise,A,A1,"It doesn‚Äôt make the company look reputable when they offer a high interest rate only to drop it immediately after gaining enough users. It feels like a bait, which it is. They should acquire deposits through more honest and transparent methods."

60,45139,GXS,Apple,1,Negative,Complaint,D,D1,GXS touted a 3.48% interest in their savings pocket only to change the interest to 2.68% within a short period of only a month. A bank is only as good as it‚Äôs promises and this bank just lost it all. Will never use GXS again.

I then left them a message. They told me to tap on a notification to authorise a payment in the app, but I couldn't. I referred this to another customer service personnel and was told the same thing, and insisting there is a notification i can tap to unlock my card, when I tried tapping every single one of my notifications in app, with 0 of them giving me any instructions 

When i asked if theres a Website to access the notifications, or if the bank can unlock the card from their side, the customer service officer just said ‚Äúthey‚Äôll refer my case and unlock my card in 3 working days‚Äù, and asked if I have any other issues.

Extremely annoyed at this entire situation, and if this app can streamline the customer service process, I would have rated it higher."
134,44958,Trust,Apple,5,Negative,Feedback,C,C2,"Been using it for 3 months, everything‚Äôs great! Getting bonuses just by spending $200 outside of NTUC is so much less stressful and much more achievable than some other banks which require spending $500 monthly. Love the coupons and vouchers, first time having an app where the coupons/vouchers are much more relatable and useful, just my personal opinion. Notifications will be there whenever there‚Äôs a new transaction or the transaction has been processed. Using it for transactions overseas was also really convenient. Customer service was good too, not sure why there are so many people complaining about it. App is smooth overall, just some hiccups when Face ID was suddenly not available (deleting and re-download the app helps). But knowing that it‚Äôs still a very new digital bank, these kinds of errors may be unavoidable at the start. Great job overall, keep it up!"
135,44805,Trust,Apple,1,Positive,Feedback,B,B1,"On 04Sept, i accidentally clicked ‚Äúyes‚Äù to be enrolled into their insurance plan. I immediately called their Customer Service hotline which said to be ‚Äú24*7‚Äù however no one answered. I have been keep calling in the last three days and no matter what time I cal and how long I wait, there is forever no one answers. I feel like calling to a ghost. Imagine the other your card was lost and need immediate attention but no one is there to help you, do you still want to bank with them?
On 05Sept, I left a message in the chat group for help. After waiting for hours, someone answered saying I can cancel either on the Insurance‚Äôs official website or via email. I wrote an email and followed up twice in the last two days, but again, no one reply. Then I asked in the chat group on 06Sept on how to cancel on website since no one replies my email, and again, after waiting for hours, they told they also not sure and need a specialist to advise‚Ä¶However, till now there is still no so called ‚ÄúSpecialist‚Äù to contact me‚Ä¶
Such digital bank like Trust might be good at beginning with promotions/coupons. But what can eventually make their customers stay is the ‚ÄúService‚Äù. Can your imagine their Customer Service is like such?"
136,45139,Trust,Apple,1,Positive,Complaint,A,A2,"The interface is not intuitive at all. You literally have to keep tap this and that to get between pages. It's infuriating to say the least. Not to mention, whoever is running this credit card is probably the most apathetic person on Earth. Literally makes you feel like you owe them. Late payment? Good luck. You got to plead your case. Asked for a waiver but you need to provide reason. Are we in school? The cs makes you feel like they are doing you a service and you should be grateful. ""On a one-time goodwill"" I quote them. There's nothing good about this card other than the zero foreign transaction fees. Be careful not to miss your repayment date and think before you set it cause you cannot change it. Very incredibly inflexible to say the least. The cs increases your blood pressure. Even telcos have better cs. Sign for the freebies, redeem those and run. Please get this right, customers do not owe you our business. Stop giving us your elitist attitude. It really feels like I have to praise the gods and kiss the feet of your cs cause they waived a fee. ü§Æ

And the developer's replies is even more infuriating. It's like rubbing it in your face. Not replying is even better than replying some sarcastic template reply."
137,44958,Trust,Apple,5,Neutral,Feedback,C,C2,"Hi, I‚Äôve been using trust bank for a while now and it is very user friendly and the notifications on transactions are very quick. App is also user friendly. I dont know if my recommendation will ever be implemented but i really hope it does because it will help trust bank stand out from other digibank apps even more. my recommendation is to add a section in the UI to include monthly spendings breakdown by categories. since trust bank already categorises our transactions (groceries, shopping, transport etc), the addition of a pie chart of our spending by category will really elevate the user experience to the next level."
138,45200,Trust,Apple,1,Neutral,Complaint,C,C2,"If you‚Äôre a first-time salaried employee and would wish to get a credit card from Trust, you will have no choice but to wait for (S$30,000/your monthly salary) months for your CPF contribution to ‚Äútell‚Äù the bank that you‚Äôve cumulatively earned the qualifying sum in a year, before they can approve your credit card. There‚Äôs no case-by-case assessment available. This is quite a departure from a friendly and smart digital bank image that Trust is trying to portray, and this is ironically, particularly unfriendly to their target audience, young population who are more well-versed in and receptive of technology. Do something, perhaps?

Update: I‚Äôve enquired again through the in app chat as instructed by the reply, the correspondent threw me the same reason, telling me I didn‚Äôt meet the requirements. So I decided to get creative and tried applying a Standard Chartered (Trust‚Äôs partial owner) card using SingPass, guess what, instant approval.

I received the same response every time stating that the ‚ÄúFraud Team is still investigating‚Äù and ‚Äúthere‚Äôs nothing they can do from their end as it‚Äôs pending the Fraud Team‚Äôs action‚Äù. I‚Äôve no clue what the Fraud Team is investigating when I, the owner of the card, has already confirmed the transaction. And even if a investigation was needed, it‚Äôs been more than 12 hours and still no progress? For similar issues with other banks, usually the customer service officer would be able to help and have the card unlocked within 30mins. Other than the fast credit card approval process, the time taken for Trust Bank to resolve matters have really made the banking experience an unpleasant one."

When I first applied for the card, I set a very low credit limit of $2.5k when my salary would qualify for a much higher limit, thinking that if I want to use it more, I could always ask for an increase in the credit limit later, just like how we do with other banks. It is a total disappointment to be given such a reply that it is not possible. I asked if their back office can‚Äôt process a simple credit limit increase request, then does this warrant a card cancellation and a re-application to get a higher credit limit; and the reply was that this is still subject to the bank‚Äôs review.

3) your digital platform has lack a couple of options for customer to choose from , I‚ÄôveSearch for service for paperless statement Nowhere to be found which I feel that this is a service that you need to improve on .

4) payment methods: it is unclear how I can make the payment, DBS ibanking?/AXN machine ? 

5) understand that this is a join product ( NTUC together with Standard chartered ,but It is rather confusing for customer like us to find an appropriate solutions Prior to our problems. When you promoted this card( or E card if you may say ) but filing the gaps such as payments/functions/backend services needs to improve.

I can track the point every day, with ocbc its always a surprise and it makes me spend more because I don't want to loose on bonuses. Will be good to show us the update in real-time and not few days later"
186,44835,Trust,Apple,3,Neutral,Complaint,B,B1,"It is most annoying that one MUST switch on the notifications for this app. The amount of unnecessary adverts is frustrating and yet we are not allowed to switch off notifications. 
And the app is too slow. Takes too long to startup! Get rid of fancy app intro and let us enter the app more easily."
187,44927,Trust,Apple,5,Positive,Complaint,C,C2,"the card is informative . it provides info such as how much more to spend outside NTUC to qualify for the bonus .

it will be good if it can also prompt us expiring coupons 4-5 days before expiry so that we do not miss out the promotion or offer ."

But the best part is when they can‚Äôt address your issue, their best solution - ask you if there is anything else they can assist you with, and in a blink of any eye, the CS quickly end the chat without giving you a chance to respond. Amazingly amazed!"

192,44986,Trust,Apple,1,Neutral,Feedback,C,C2,"One of the benefits that digital banking supposed to give to it's users is to allow usage of financial services even out of Singapore. Traveling is back to norm and it's getting common, yet trust bank disallows users to apply a credit card when traveling out of Singapore. This made this digital bank worst off than traditional banks that allows users to have access to digital services when traveling out of Singapore."

Yeap and I agree with the pending verifications. Why do U need such a long time ?In any case, real happy that I have deleted the app and in fact, after taking personal details I feel paranoid actually.

To date, I still haven‚Äôt got my Dec statement in any app. After speaking to customer service, still nothing is updated. And I was told my due date is 28 Dec. Pls keep data updated and this concerns dollars and cents. And being a digital bank, this is more so important cos users are dependent on the app."
200,44866,Trust,Apple,1,Negative,Complaint,A,A2,"The first month 7.5% rebate has been missing simply after a few days. There‚Äôs no clear indication that it‚Äôs by calendar month. Means if you sign up near the end of the month, u are out of luck. Due to heavy promotion activities there‚Äôs a lot of demand for this card. But I see long term risk with this bank as there‚Äôs no clear customer service, support or even a proper website with the bank. It‚Äôs all going through the phone app."
201,44835,Trust,Apple,1,Negative,Complaint,C,C2,"I have been using its credit card for a month and have been trying to pay the bill but to my horror, this app always stop me from adding its credit card account as payee.

This isn‚Äôt possible cos I allowed the app to collect info and send me notifications all the time."
203,45261,Trust,Apple,2,Positive,Feedback,A,A2,"Good exchange rates. Simple app. 

However the in-app chat CS is downright pathetic. She can‚Äôt understand my question after repeating myself THREE times, copy and pastes answers like a bot, and cuts the conversation short even though she never answered my question and didn‚Äôt give me a chance to respond. Just pastes an answer then says ‚Äúif that‚Äôs all, I‚Äôll be ending this chat.‚Äù And proceeds to quit the chat in less than 2 seconds."
204,44958,Trust,Apple,1,Neutral,Complaint,A,A2,"I applied for the credit card on the 1st day and till date, still has not been approved with multiple calls to their support with no resolution and multiple uninstall/reinstallation of the app as advised by their support. Every time they promised that there will be someone calling me back to update the situation but it has never happened. I give up. The scam calls that I get have better response than this."

206,44805,Trust,Apple,1,Negative,Complaint,A,A2,"Said to offer instant approval, it took 2 weeks to receive approval of savings account, after some irrelevant ‚Äúverification‚Äù.

Wanted to move the sign-in of APP from iPad Air to my iPhone, was told by the in-APP team to delete my installation on iPad first which I did. Now I am locked out totally, even with the latest 1.0.7 update. 

Only mean to communicate with Trust Bank is via the help desk, which said will revert within 3 business days. Surely the bank can do much better?!"
207,44958,Trust,Apple,5,Neutral,Complaint,C,C2,"Initially I thought the card would be useful for basically my shopping at NTUC. Soon I realised that there is a lot more to the card then just that. 
- convenience of card payment
- excellent vouchers and promotions
- no charge on forex transactions

I think the last point should be emphasised in marketing efforts as that is really a benefit especially for online bookings for holidays as well as use the same when on foreign trips. Even for children studying overseas this would be beneficial."
208,44866,Trust,Apple,1,Negative,Praise,D,D1,"Referred friends to sign up, was issued the $10 FairPrice voucher but when I wanted to redeem at FairPrice, was told that the voucher was already redeemed before. Approach their super slow, inefficient and ineffective CS chat team, was told they will get back to me, which they didn‚Äôt. Worst, they like to close the chat and mark it as resolved each time just to achieve their service levels. This bank is crap. I will stop recommending my friends."
209,44986,Trust,Apple,1,Neutral,Complaint,D,D1,I have a Trust saving account which is used to honour transactions purchased using Trust card. I noticed that all transactions tend to be in pending status and it took a couple of days for transactions to change to complete status. This issue need to be addressed by the developer as it derive user additional bonus interest. Transactions debited from saving should be complete status as funds already deducted from saving account.

216,45231,Trust,Apple,1,Negative,Feedback,A,A2,"One big flaw of Trust Bank app is the inability to automatically mark the voucher as ‚ÄúRedeemed‚Äù after using it. Users have to manually mark it as redeemed. This obviously raise possibility of human errors, and bringing inconvenience.

233,45292,Trust,Apple,5,Negative,Complaint,A,A2,The payment notification approval does not say anything about what to approve what amount which merchant...a very dangerous feature...especially with card hijacking.

235,44835,Trust,Apple,1,Neutral,Praise,A,A2,"App doesnt work and credit card isnt instant approval and it causes other apps to have issues. App probably got bugs. Also; your singpass may be affected, well at least mine did. Download at your own risk.

Update: So my singpass did get affected and its due to bugs from this app. Its also constantly retrieving your details and messes up your details and information. High risk and im never trusting this UNTRUSTED App or bank again."

237,45231,Trust,Apple,1,Positive,Praise,D,D2,It‚Äôs easy to get slapped with a late payment charge. Funny thing is the app notification tells you are have been slapped with a penalty but doesn‚Äôt remind you to make payment. What‚Äôs more they only waive the penalty for one time..2nd time and there‚Äôs no more waiver. A $100 slapped for a $14 spend on the card. Ridiculous. Effinn ridiculous. That‚Äôs how this ‚Äòbank‚Äô makes money by low infrastructure cost and inflexible policies
238,44805,Trust,Apple,5,Positive,Praise,C,C2,There are still some kinks to iron out with the linkpoints process in store especially since I‚Äôm only using the digital card. But app wise it‚Äôs user friendly.

240,44927,Trust,Apple,1,Positive,Feedback,D,D2,You‚Äôre better off using the services of other banks.

In simple, their business is to make money out of their customer and not customer/ client based.

One of the worse banks and card, used to be as bad as Citibank, but Citibank Cust service had improved a lot.

Your Bank is no doubt is an excellent service in terms of easy usage and plenty of heartland shop‚Äôs promotions that are being offered. 

However I really wish that my monthly salary can be transferred or credited to my Trust Bank account just like other banks did. I was disappointed to learn from your customer service department that your bank don‚Äôt provide such services as I mentioned earlier.

I truly hope that your bank could implement the monthly salary or even the yearly government GSTV payout to be credited via fast or whatsoever credit transfer system that your bank could implement.

I look forward to your Bank representative reply pertaining to the suggestion that I mentioned above. Please look into this matter considerably and with a positive outcome.Thank you."

649,44927,Trust,Apple,1,Positive,Praise,A,A3,I didn‚Äôt know each customer only had 1 chance to waive of late charge. I made my payment for $13.90 on Fri and I didn‚Äôt know the interbank takes 3 days so I was slapped with $100 fee again. Since I used up my chance the customer service officer will submit for approval. I already made late payments before when I was truly late. Trust has earned more late fee from me since my payments were very little and once I was charged for late fee as I left out $1 when I made my payment. Definitely not a bank for more complex transactions as the customer service is terrible and they go by the book instead of listening to the customer. The fella seems happy that I want to close my card too. A bank needs to listen to customer needs and not just give rewards.

Suggest that rather than working on cool, but otherwise non-essential functions (like saving pockets), the company should focus on the basics first."

While it's true that there's a risk of malware-related scams, I know what apps I've installed and can discern which are proper and which aren't (most of these have been used for close to 10 years now). Giving users a chance to whitelist trusted apps seems like the better protocol. Who are you to police what apps I have on my phone? I know which to choose btwn a replaceable banking app & a trusted app that provides me convenience"

They do not have GIRO arrangements which is prone to late payments. And then they expect you to open their app 24X7 just to look for their notifications. If you are too busy to do that and your phone somehow auto-blocked their spammy push notifications, then you are doomed. You will be charged with $100 SGD late payment + 30% PA interest and no waiver whatsoever. Scam!"

967,45323,Trust,Android,1,Negative,Praise,B,B2,App having problem transferring or paynow. Caller the hotline and Trust team informed me to try again in 24 hrs' time. Shouldn't Trust bank inform of a glitch and also send a notification to user once the bug had been fixed rather than asking us to try 24hrs later? The trust bank team replied that they are unable to do it. It's 24 hrs to CNY and Trust bank screw up big time. DBS CEO took a 30% payout for their glitch. Please tell your CEO to have some dignity and lead by example as well.

981,45323,Trust,Android,2,Negative,Feedback,C,C3,Can you guys properly white-list the application for accessibility settings before saying they are malware applications? You guys block Norton 360 and Microsoft Authenticator in the application without properly checking.
982,45323,Trust,Android,1,Neutral,Feedback,D,D4,"The way the count purchase to the accumulated links rewards is depend on merchant posting date. So you can spend all you want in thr month but still can loos all accumulated rewards if the merchant decides to post yout purchase the next month. Really stupid policy. By the way the card charges you even if merchant does not post the purchase yet. If finish spending 10 days before. Might as well say spend within the first 20 days of month. I talk to ur service, reply is basically too bad :("
983,45323,Trust,Android,1,Negative,Praise,A,A4,absolutely pathetic... flagged out genuine and perfectly safe apps and refuse to run instead of minding its own business... if the trust app is worried about rogue applications then trust should beef up its own security instead and be unpenentrable by rogue apps instead of taking the short cut out and block 3rd party apps... and adding salt on the wound it forces u to enable app notifications and it is so intrusive to suddenly receive marketing campaign when i am busy... have cancelled my card..
